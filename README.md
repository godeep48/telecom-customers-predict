<b>A Telecommunication Company categorized their customers into four different group as,</b>
<ul>
    <li>1 - Basic Service</li>
    <li>2 - E-Service</li>
    <li>3 - Plus Service</li>
    <li>4 - Total Service</li>
</ul>
<b>So in this kernel let us use it to build a machine learning model using k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict which customer belongs to which category.</b>
